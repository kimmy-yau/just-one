#Just One

## Introduction

Hello! This is my first Python project and it is based off "Just One" boardgame by Ludovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter.
I started learning Python - getting to know the basics. I thought it would be a fun little project to kick off my Python journey.

## Installation

Run main.py to start the game!

## Roadmap

There are still some flaws with the game:

- Hints are not checked against the Mystery word.
- Relies on correct spelling to get the point.
- Add a skip option if the Mystery word is unknown to players.
